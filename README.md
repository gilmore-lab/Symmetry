Symmetry - R. Gilmore, P. Kohler, T. Norcia

This script is used for an event-related fMRI study of brain activation patterns to visual patterns that come from
a subset of the 17 wallpaper groups. The patterns have been synthesized so that the spectral power within each wallpaper
group is normalized among the 20 exemplars of the patterns. There are both intact and phase-scrambled versions of each
wallpaper group stimulus. Phase scrambling turns wallpapers into members of p1.

## Dependencies
