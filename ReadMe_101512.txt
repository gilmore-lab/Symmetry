Symmetry Project - Presentation and Response Recording
Developed on MATLAB 7.10.0 (R2010a) and PsychToolbox 3.0.8

Contents:
- param_setup.m
- symmetry.m
- ‘data’ directory

This script was designed for experimental protocols as of 7/2/12:
- 1 second pattern presentation / 1 second blank presentation.
- 5 pattern types (square, super-square, pi/2, pi/3, pi/4).
- 5 presentations are repeated twice for a total of 10 presentations.
- Response recording is based on change of fixation color (red/green).
- Fixation color has a chance to change at each 1s presentation window.
- Output is in comma-separated format, headers include (in column order):
1. Block number
2. Pattern type
3. Fixation change
4. Reaction time
5. Hit/Miss

Scripting Infrastructure:
- Presentation and response recording are independent processes.
- Press escape key at any time to abort script.
- params_setup.m can be modified at your own risk. For example, timing is
restricted to 1 second presentations – this cannot modified without adjusting
object timer properties.
- After presentation, output is saved to the ‘data’ directory.

Usage:
- Call ‘symmetry’ at MATLAB command line.
- A prompt will ask whether manual (4.75s delay) or automated trigger start is
required.
- Next, a prompt will request subject ID information and date (entered by
default). This data is used to name the output .csv file.
